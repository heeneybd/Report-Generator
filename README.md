# Report-Generator
This program generates weekly comments for each student in a class based on their performance.

It takes an excel file "rabbit_class" where a score of 1-3 is assigned for student in each category.
A "1" would be a high score but a "3" would indicate the child needs improvement in the category.

The code then randomly selects from a list comments for each category based on the 1-3 score.
Finally, the sentences are organized in a random order to form a short paragraph.
The idea is that this paragraph, or student comment, will be different each time the program is run even if the student has the same scores in each category.  It will generate a unique paragraph each time in a grammatically correct way that sounds natural.

This program was created by Braden Heeney in October, 2019.
